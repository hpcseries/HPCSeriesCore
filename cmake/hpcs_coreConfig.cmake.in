# HPCSeries Core CMake Package Configuration
#
# Enables downstream projects to find and link against HPCSeries Core
# using: find_package(hpcs_core CONFIG REQUIRED)
#
# This file is generated during installation and provides the hpcs::hpcs_core target
# for SignalCore and other C++ consumers.
#
# Example usage in downstream CMakeLists.txt:
#   find_package(hpcs_core 0.8 CONFIG REQUIRED)
#   target_link_libraries(my_target PRIVATE hpcs::hpcs_core)
#

@PACKAGE_INIT@

# Find dependencies required by HPCSeries Core
# OpenMP is required (Core uses Fortran component, but we let CMake handle transitive dependencies)
# Downstream projects should enable OpenMP for their own language (C++, C, etc.)

# Include target definitions (hpcs::hpcs_core)
