# Configuration Notes:
#
# To enable Trusted Publishing on PyPI:
# 1. Go to: https://pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/
# 2. Add a new pending publisher with these details:
#    - PyPI Project Name: hpcs
#    - Owner: hpcseries
#    - Repository name: HPCSeriesCore
#    - Workflow name: publish-to-pypi.yml
#    - Environment name: (leave empty)
#
# For TestPyPI (optional, for testing):
# 1. Go to: https://test.pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/
# 2. Add the same configuration
#
# After configuration, this workflow will automatically publish when:
# - You create a GitHub release
# - You manually trigger the workflow
#
# No API tokens needed! GitHub OIDC provides temporary credentials.
